  I am sharing some other ideas I had for 3D prints and other benefits using this SVG pallete. If anyone or the Hush team wants to expand or make changes, please do so. 
Keep in mind, this is not to change Hush official logo, but more for other creative ideas like physical prints of coins and inexpensive paper wallet coins and other. :)

*The files attached are: plain SVG, inkscape SVG, PNG screenshot, and a PDF for preview of vectors. I logically seperated each piece for ease of transition or changes to 2D or 3D ideas.* 

*[Opt]If you are using Inkscape, please use the inkscape SVG format.*
